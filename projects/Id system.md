This a legally distinct copy of one of the most iconic messages, as far as computers a concerned. "Hello, world"

<pre>

This program is entirely designed and made to just display a message.
There is plenty more intricate and complex programs to come. I did not type this program right the first few times, I kept forgetting the console.log.ln command repeatedly. This display method is used in so many programs and it is the only reason I was able to have text-based visuals for a vase majority of my projects throughout ICS 111.

I mostly found myself using this simple message system to display objects that I created.
It's a wonderful and convenient tool for troubleshooting/testing. It is infact my go-to method to testing the functionality of my programs. In a way it is like popping the hood to a car and checking out what's wrong. I am more a visual person and the lines of code doesn't always jump out as much as error popping up forcibly by the console.log command does.

I was originally going to show my very complex ID system/snack bar program, but I seem to have misplaced it. I wrote a lot of these on a older laptop I had at the start of college. It still works but there are large gaps in time between my programming classes, mostly due to clas canclelations. That program makes my think back to how simple the first few programs were.
