This a legally distinct copy of one of the most iconic messages, as far as computers a concerned. "Hello, world"

This program is entirely designed and made to just display a message.
There is plent more intricate and complex programs to come.

I mostly found myself using this simple message system to display objects that I created.
It's a wonderful and convenient tool for troubleshooting/testing
