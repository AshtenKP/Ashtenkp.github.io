Here is a snippet of the code.

<pre>
This creates a simple stat sheet, based on pokemon. While we were not tasked with making a game using these files created by the program, it could potetentially be used. It was very quick to put together, while much more simple than the full-fledged ID system and grocery store inventory system that I also had to create in ICS 111, this one felt the most personally engaging.

I will definetly be using this to make a rpg on my own time. This code works as one of the main building blocks to making an rpg character. These values are called to all the time, to show number-based scaling and the main form of gameplay involving these essential stats. I was really starting to see the potential of making my own projects using my coding experience.

I get the gist of it but a lot more is involved with a game. Although a lot of programs we use today are incredibly complicated. A slow-mo footage of a smart phone screen shows the insane amount of detail put into the display. A lot of the polished features, whether that's visuals or time-saving features, often reffered to as "Quality of Life" improvements.
