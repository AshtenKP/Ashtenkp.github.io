## The downloading process

It was quite challenging to get this program working.
The windows operating system was not orignally designed to use this program.
This lead to multiple uses, some were fixed by running the installer using the "run as administrator" option.
After the install process, it was imeditely apart what this program was capable of.

## Using ESLint

While my time with ESLint is very brief, it is quite handy.
Being able to have a second set of eyes that helps watch out for error is very nice.
The few IDE programs I have used, mostly for Java. 
These assistive tools have been quite helpful with getting me on track with my program.
It doesn't automatically fix errors, but it can give quick-fixes to a few errors it finds.
Its very good at catching errors and critiqueing the program, its brutually honest but that is much needed.
