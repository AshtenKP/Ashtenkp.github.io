By posting this, this proves that it works.

It's a lot better to use an IDE program to write and read code.

The tools available and suggestions the program provide are incredibly useful.

Eclispe is my go to but VScode seems to work decently well, although big files makes it slow down.

This whole website thing is really cool. It would be nice to learn how to make own from scratch.
