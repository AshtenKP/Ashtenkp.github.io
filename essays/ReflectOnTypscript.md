Typescript, an extentsion of JavaScript that isn't even remotely like Java. The whole marketing thing with the Java in JavaScript was very confusing for me.
JavaScript is a similar to Java as C++ is to Java, or any Coding language for that matter. I like TypeScript's name much more.

I am not sure if I really understand the appeal of TypeScript. I found myself wanting to use regular JavaScript a lot in the begining.
I can sortof see why specifying types is more controlled.
In this sense, I found just the formating to be very confusing and sometimes frustrating.
At first it was because I was trying to type JavaScript only stuff and eventually it was me trying to not default to typing out regular Java code.

The fundamentals of the Java still carry over to JavaScript/TypeScript. Classes, constructors, objects, the primative values, it is all still there. 
In way this coding language is like how Spanish is to English, or atleast that how I viewed it in the begining. 
I see it now as more of a dilect of my native language, or maybe these aren't the best analogies.

I find that this coding language works quite well. It will take a lot of getting used to, which is my only real struggle with it. 
Much like everyone I have spoken to about this coding language, its just another options that I will have to learn. 
I wonder what it would be like to clearn C++, phython, or C sharp.

The WODs are the types of things I dread the most in school. It is like a regulary scheduled Exam for programming. I don't do well under such pressure but my change of mindset has made it more managable. 
The previous semester I could not handle the pressure and I couldn't make the time commitement. I did spiral a lot in response to it, I genuienly didn't think I could or wanted to do this anymore. 
I eventually after a while decided to tough it out, I don't have any other option. If I can make it through these WODS, then i'm sure I will be just fine going forward in my degree path.
