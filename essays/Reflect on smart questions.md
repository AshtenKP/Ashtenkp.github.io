Eric Raymond's guidelines for asking smart questions is actually how I usually ask questions.
I usually will do everything in capabilities to not answer simple or dumb questions.
I will absolutely scrub through my options, until I have no other options.
I have used forum threads before, you usally will be mocked for asking dumb questions.

Your answer involving computers is likely out there, someone has most defintely been in your exact situation before.
Most of the time your answer was already there, if you looked hard enought and that was what has lead to my success with learning computers.

In the technical world there are a lot of stupid questions, I sometimes encounter it will everyday people. 
I have had multiple encounters were people genuienly didn't know that the on/off switch for your power supply is not the same as the power button on the front of the pc.
Dumb questions like that happen, but it feels like a waste of time and that the person isn't trying hard enough.
By simply watching someone else turn on a desktop pc from storage, you have your solution.
That is why it is not a smart question, the answer should be a lot more obvious than it is.

Smart questions in a way are the tough questions by nature.
As seen by the StackOverFlow forum, one of the questions involves if the catching errors should be done first or last.
The best two answers was a callboration between two users. One gave an answer but another use felt otherwise.
The original user edited their response with an example, which is the most widely accepted answer in the thread.
However, other users seem to have not answered the question or responsded with vague responses, generalized and doesn't even bother giving an answer.
They can be, "either works just fine", or "it depends", "your example doesn't apply here", "actually, how about option c", "do both".
Until the top answer was reworked and refined, the answers on the forum were not very helpful, which is just how forum posts go.

An example of not-so smart question. A user uploads a giant program and expects someone to figure it out.
The question involves several conditions all of them being apart of their ios-based search bar system.
They specifically want the search bar to display "query" being search, I find the question to be confusing.
In some ways this system works but also doesn't, 33 other people seem to have seen this and gave up.
The original poster got one response, but apparently it doesn't fit with the solutions they are trying for, 
which defeats the point of asking the question.
This individual violates one of the conditions, which is to be concise and specific to what they are looking for, 
which they only added these details after critisizing the only answer they got.

It is easy to see which one got more engagement and ultimately an equally smart answer. Smart questions done right are the way to go.
