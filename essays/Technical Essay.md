While I am majoring in computer science. I am quite interested in learing software engineering.
I always wondered what it would take to program something myself. It was more challenging then I could have ever imagined. Yet, through it all I find a greater satisfaction towards digital engineering through my time in high school.

In highschool I sought the engineering path field, I likely would've choosen that had I not come up with the idea to pursue computers. I had an incredibly hard time coming up with designs to structures. I tried both pathways available, one more focused on wood work and the other on CAD design. I wound up liking the more software focused one, despite my hurdles with arcitectural design. I didn't feel like I had the kind of mind to think up all of the logistics behind an actual building, looks, feels, ventalation, safety, it was all too much to work on at a time.

I went into college wanting to do something that actually felt worth it. I personally feel college really isn't for small things and pursueing a meaningless degree will lead to great disapointment in the workfield. I stumbled upon computer science, after dicovering the name for it in the past few years then. I knew it was going to be very challeging and that I hardly had any experience, but this is the only thing that make pursue college. I went for it and here we are now.

Now that I have had a lot of time with coding. I want to sharpen my skills in a multitude of ways. Efficienty, problem solving, a balanced schedule, troublshooting, quality work, fixing errors and more to come. I encounter a lot of road blocks when coding, sometimes the tiniest little mistake can be a 30 minute headache, of which I want to try and reduce those ecounters. There are a lot shortcuts and clever solutions to these coding assignments and I want to try and improve my ability to do so. I feel like I just need more experience to achive that and so I wanted to start doing my own personal coding projects.

My main interest in comuters was their ability to make the thing I enjoy most, video games. Just the way they operate and all of the engieering genius that goes into these games blows my mind. The way they are able to render movie-like graphics on-the-fly is very interesting to me. It is exciting to see that now is the best time to start making games. There are so many tools and my degree can help me achieve to a much more advanced level. I genuienly believe I had already found my calling, it just feels so right and I wouldn't have it any other way.
